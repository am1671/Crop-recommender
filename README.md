# Crop-recommender

An interactive website which diplays which crops are suitable to be grown in various regions in the state of Maharashtra based on various factors such as soil type, climate, soil pH.<br><br>
> a. The crops are represented using colourful icons which upon clicking reveal more information about the location in an info-window like the name of the place where it is suitable to be grown in, soil pH and the soil sub-type.<br><br>
b. A user can enter their location as well to find out which crop is suitable to be grown in their region by using the search box which uses Places API to search for locations.<br><br>
c. The user can enter their location using various options such as GeoCode, Cities, Regions, Establishment, Address.<br>

<br>The project was built using Google Maps API and Places Library and utilizes HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Note: The website uses the Google Maps API which bills devs who utilize the API over a certain limit so i have set a daily limit which might break the displaying of the map if the limit is exceeded.
